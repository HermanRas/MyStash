# The smoke tests cover App/src/Playlists.php directly, which is where the
# ordering and membership rules live. This covers what the smoke tests cannot:
# that the endpoints in front of that model are wired to it, that they refuse
# what they should, and that a playlist survives a round trip through the
# encrypted index rather than only through an array in memory.
#
# Runs against a throwaway stash it creates and deletes.
