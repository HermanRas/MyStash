# 7.2 — command-injection safety at the boundary where PHP runs other programs.
#
# The unit-level proof lives in smoke_test.php ("hostile input at the command
# boundary"). This is the other half: the same hostile values pushed through
# the real HTTP endpoints a browser talks to, on a throwaway stash, so the
# whole stack is exercised — nginx, php-fpm, the session, the upload handler —
# rather than the classes in isolation.
#
# Canaries are checked *inside the php container*, because that is where the
# command would run. Checking the host would pass no matter what happened.
