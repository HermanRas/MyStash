# Builds the demo stash the README screenshots are taken from.
#
# Everything here goes through the real HTTP endpoints — register, upload,
# video_save, creator_save, category_save, playlist_save — so the result is a
# stash the app itself produced, not one written behind its back. That matters
# for a README: the screenshots then show what a user would actually get.
#
# The assignment of videos to creators and categories is fixed rather than
# random. It reads as random, and it is reproducible, so re-running this after
# a UI change gives a wall that can be compared with the last screenshots
# instead of a different wall every time.
#
# Usage: dev/seed_sample_data.sh [source-dir] [user] [password]
