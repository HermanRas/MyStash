/**
 * Detached background jobs, and the record of how they are getting on
 * (Docs/PLAN.md 4.28, 6.6).
 *
 * Two pieces of work in this app take minutes rather than milliseconds —
 * transcoding a video and re-keying a whole stash — and both used to run
 * *inside* the request that asked for them. That is wrong for the obvious
 * reason (the browser sits on a pending request until it finishes) and for a
 * worse one: it was the single-threaded PHP server, so the entire site queued
 * behind the transcode and stopped answering at all.
 *
 * So: the request writes a job record, spawns a worker detached from itself,
 * and returns immediately. The worker does the work and writes its progress
 * into the record. The page polls a small endpoint and draws a bar.
 *
 * Everything lives in tmpfs, never on disk:
 *
 *  - `{id}.json`  the public record — state, counts, message. Never secrets.
 *  - `{id}.key`   the passwords the worker needs, mode 0600, deleted by the
 *                 worker the moment it has read them.
 *  - `{id}.lock`  held under an exclusive flock for the worker's whole life,
 *                 which is how anyone else can tell a worker is still alive
 *                 without trusting the record to be honest about it.
 *
 * Putting the passwords in a tmpfs file is not a new exposure: the session that
 * started the job is *already* a file in /dev/shm holding the same password
 * (see Session). What matters is that it is RAM — gone on container restart,
 * never written to the persistent volume — and that it is not on the worker's
 * argv, where `ps` would show it to anything else in the container.
