/**
 * Throttling for login attempts (Docs/PLAN.md 7.3).
 *
 * What this can and cannot do is worth being precise about, because the
 * obvious reason to rate-limit a login does not apply here.
 *
 * **It does not protect the data.** The password is the encryption key and is
 * never stored; there is nothing to compare a guess against, and anyone
 * holding a copy of `App/Data` attacks the archives offline at whatever speed
 * their hardware allows, with this code nowhere in the picture. Length is the
 * only defence there, which is what 7.0.1 is for.
 *
 * **What it does protect is the running service**, in two ways:
 *
 *  - **CPU.** Every login attempt against an existing stash spawns 7z to try
 *    an AES decrypt — measured at ~130ms, against ~16ms for a name with no
 *    stash behind it. There are 16 php-fpm workers. An unauthenticated
 *    attacker can spawn that work as fast as they can POST, and the whole app
 *    stops answering: exactly the lockup 4.28 was about, from a different
 *    direction. Past the limit this refuses *before* spawning anything, so a
 *    flood becomes cheaper for the server than for the attacker.
 *  - **Online guessing** against stashes made before the 24-character minimum.
 *    Login deliberately does not enforce that minimum, so older, weaker
 *    passwords still open — and those are guessable at 16 workers' worth of
 *    attempts per second in a way a 24-character one is not.
 *
 * Two rules fall out of MyStash having no password reset and no administrator:
 *
 *  - **Nothing here is ever permanent.** A stash is its password; a lockout
 *    that did not expire on its own would mean the owner had no way back in,
 *    ever. Every counter is windowed and ages out without intervention.
 *  - **It refuses rather than sleeps.** Delaying a response holds a php-fpm
 *    worker, and with 16 of them a sleep long enough to matter *is* the denial
 *    of service it was meant to prevent. The one exception is the constant
 *    time floor below, which is small and bounded.

     * someone else.
     *
