/**
 * Starts a conversion. Does not perform one (Docs/PLAN.md 4.28).
 *
 * This used to run ffmpeg inside the request. On the single-threaded built-in
 * server that did not merely make this one request slow — every other page,
 * thumbnail and range request queued behind the transcode, and the whole site
 * stopped answering until the container was restarted. Now the work goes to a
 * detached worker and this returns straight away; the watch page polls
 * job_status.php and draws a bar.
 *
 * Pressing Convert twice cannot start a second run: the job id is derived from
 * the user and the video, so the second press finds the first job.
